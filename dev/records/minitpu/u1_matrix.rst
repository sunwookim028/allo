U1 findings matrix (README D-9)
===============================

One row per unit, one column per tool. Cells: **match**, **finding** (with its
class: bug, missing abstraction, workaround, semantic mismatch), **blocked**,
or **n/a**. Each finding links to its evidence. Started 2026-10-02 on
zhang-21; MiniTPU at ``b3ba0a4d``; harness on branch ``u1-pilot``.

   * - Tool
     - Cell
     - Evidence / note
   * - Allo simulator, ``native``
     - **finding, semantic mismatch**: 250,955/251,936 match; the 981 others
       are the RTL's two non-IEEE rules (NaN always ``+0x7FC0``; ``(+0)+(-0) =
       -0``)
     - ``harness/check.py``; ``docs/source/designs/minitpu.rst`` ("The unit
       ladder"). Allo's ``bfloat16`` has IEEE semantics with no way to state
       a unit's own NaN/zero rules.
   * - Allo simulator, ``bits``
     - in progress (branch ``u1-bits``)
     -
   * - SystemC csim, ``native``
     - **finding, bug** x3 (emitter): the ``ac::bfloat16`` ``sc_trace``
       overload is in the global namespace, invisible to ADL, so any bf16
       Connections port fails to compile; the testbench feeds all of input 0
       before input 1 from one thread, so any unit with two interleaved
       streamed inputs deadlocks (0 outputs, even at n=200); float values
       cross the testbench as decimal text (``nan``/``inf``)
     - Fixes on branch ``systemc-u1-fixes``. The existing bf16 test only
       checked emission, so the compile error was never seen.
   * - Catapult csyn / RTL
     - in progress (branch ``u1-catapult``)
     -
   * - RTLGen, ``native``
     - **finding, semantic mismatch + missing abstraction**: 249,995/251,936
       match. The others are NaN encodings (RTLGen keeps sign and payload)
       and ``(+0)+(-0)``. The adder is an extern Vivado IP with no RTL body,
       so cosim checks a DPI-C model, and ``add_rtl_model`` is unimplemented
     - ``u1_bf16_add_rtlgen_2026-10-02.rst`` (F1, F2)
   * - RTLGen, ``bits``
     - **match**: 251,936/251,936 bit-exact, II=1, N+6 cycles. Findings: no
       combinational kernel (latency >= 1 with start/done); a ``for`` loop
       like the ``.sv``'s gives II=48 unless it is unrolled; 32-bit
       temporaries are not narrowed
     - ``u1_bf16_add_rtlgen_2026-10-02.rst`` (F3-F5)
   * - AMC
     - **blocked**: no bf16 in its frontend or operator library; f32 needs
       DesignWare models not in the repository
     - ``dev/records/open_hls/amc_exploration_2026-10-02.rst``. A ``bits``
       (uint16) expression might pass its integer path; untried.

Environment findings met on the way
-----------------------------------

* ``LLVM_BUILD_DIR``: CLAUDE.md told sessions on zhang-21 to export a ``/home``
  LLVM build that no longer exists there; the simulator then fails with
  ``Unknown function <top>``. Fixed in ``4904eadc``.
* The emitted SystemC testbench and Catapult's g++ 10.3: the ``allo`` env's
  activate script puts ``gcc-toolset-13`` first and Catapult's module puts its
  own ``python`` first; ``harness/env-zhang21.sh`` fixes the order.
